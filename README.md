#Description

An exercice to learn Arduboy programming with sprite animation.

This is inspired from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban](Sokoban)
game. A working implementation for the Arduboy exists already and can be found
[https://github.com/rprouse/Arduban](here). This project uses the levels from 
[https://github.com/rprouse/Arduban](rprouse).
