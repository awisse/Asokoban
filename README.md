# Description

This is an exercice to help me learn [Arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com) programming with sprite animation.
I took inspiration from the impressive [MicroCity](https://github.com/jhhoward/MicroCity). 

When it is finished, this game will be a version of [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). 
Nothing new. A working implementation for the Arduboy exists already and can be found
[here](https://github.com/rprouse/Arduban). This project uses the levels from 
[rprouse](https://github.com/rprouse/Arduban).

The same game can be played as an Arduboy simulation on the desktop 
with the [SDL2 library](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2) if installed.
